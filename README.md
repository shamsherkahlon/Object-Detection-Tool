# Object-Detection-Tool
This tool is built to detect images of animals which are 32x32x3. The data has been taken from inbuilt datasets of keras and is called cifar10.
where training set has 50000 images and test set has 10000 images of animals broadly of 10 categories.
The images have pixel dimensions as 32x32 with 3 color channels as they are colored images. 
We will explore convolutional neural networks architecture using keras library with tensorflow backend.
This is just a basic convolutional neural network architecture model on Cifar10 to see the performance of CNN on images and understand the different complexities involved in the model
We achieved an accuracy of 71.2 % on the test dataset by using a fairly simple architecture which is not too bad.
In future we will try to improve the current metrics.
